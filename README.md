# campus-shop-platform
A web app that connects small businesses to students in the campus.

It is similar to basic version of yelp.com. It allows students in the campus to easily navigate to the local businesses they need and shop owners to showcase their shops. It has a sign up / log in system for customers and shop owners. It also has a point system which creates customer loyalty to the shops.

A front-end page for customers looks like this:

It has a headline sections which advertises latest/hotest shops in the campus. 
The section below shows all first-level shop categories and their description. When cliking, it will fetch shops under that category from the database and jump to the page which will be shown later.
The 'All Shop' link will fetch and show all shops in the database without any filtering.
A super admin module can be used to edit the data of this page.
The 'Me' section shows some buttons for the user to manage the account.
