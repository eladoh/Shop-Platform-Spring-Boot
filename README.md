# campus-shop-platform
A web app that connects small businesses to students in the campus.

It is similar to basic version of yelp.com. It allows students in the campus to easily navigate to the local businesses they need and shop owners to showcase their services. It has a sign-up/ login system for customers and shop owners. It also has a point system which creates customer loyalty to the shops.

A front-end page for customers looks like this:
